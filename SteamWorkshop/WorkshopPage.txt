This mod removes the need for dye from vanilla actions, such as dying clothes or hair, and patches Craft with Color, removing the dye requirement from recipes.
The goal is to make dye an item that's unnecessary to acquire, as it isn't very challenging/rewarding to get.
This mod achieves its goal by removing dye as a requirement to recolouring hair and apparel.
Compatibility is achieved by not removing dye - if a mod isn't patched for this it will still require dye.
